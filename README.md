# How do I approach designing software? 

When designing software, and in this context graphical programs, I begin by approaching what the creative end-goal is. What kind of graphics do we need? What engine should we use to render them? These lead to designing a scene abstract document, and then I set  up the boiler plate, in this case the systems we need for OpenGL. 

# How do I approach developing programs? 

I develop objects, so for example, if a scene would have multiple shapes and pieces, each one should be its own object. I do this to prevent any collision in code and to make maintaining and changing specific 3D pieces easier.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My new found skills in working with 3d graphics systems like OpenGL opens up a plethora of experience I could apply to more creative computer science projects - such as game development.
